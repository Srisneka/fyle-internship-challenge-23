## Running Test Cases

To run the test cases for this Angular application, you can use Angular's CLI (ng) commands. 

# Follow the steps below:

Open a Terminal: Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your project directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the root directory of your Angular project where your package.json file is located.

Run tests: Use the `ng test` command to run tests for your Angular application.

This command will compile your project and run all the unit tests in  project. It will then watch for changes in files and re-run the tests automatically whenever you make changes.

View test results: After running the tests, you'll see the test results in your terminal. Additionally, Angular CLI opens a browser window showing the test runner interface where you can see detailed test results, including which tests passed or failed.

Quit test runner: Once you're done reviewing the test results, you can quit the test runner by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.
